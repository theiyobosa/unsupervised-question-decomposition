This project is about finding ways to break down questions, before they are answered, using unsupervised techniques. The aim is to improve context in LLM solutions.

**Example**

Question: What school did James Maxwell's lawyer graduate from?

Breakdown (Decomposition):
- Who is James Maxwell?
- Who is his lawyer?
- What school did he graduate from?
